A suite of modular, multidisciplinary, mutually coherent libraries.

A collection of Rust libraries designed to provide easy-to-use solutions across
a varied range of fields and complementary needs.

They are intended to be a cohesive set of tools that work seamlessly together,
with a minimal amount of cognitive complexity.
