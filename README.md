[![MSRV: 1.72.0](https://flat.badgen.net/badge/MSRV/1.72.0/purple)](https://releases.rs/docs/1.72.0/)

A collection of Rust libraries designed to provide easy-to-use solutions across
a varied range of fields and complementary needs.

Each library is designed to be simple, intuitive, and modular.

They are intentionally interrelated, in order to provide a cohesive set of tools
that work seamlessly together. This approach simplifies programming by reducing
technical and cognitive complexity, allowing developers to focus on creating.

## Liberaries 

Here’s a list overview of the current libraries:

- [`acolor`](https://crates.io/crates/acolor): color types and operations.
- [`depura`](https://crates.io/crates/depura): logging, debugging, benchmarks.
- [`devela`](https://crates.io/crates/devela): rust dev helpers & template.
- [`espera`](https://crates.io/crates/espera): time management solutions.
- [`fisica`](https://crates.io/crates/fisica): physics.
- [`ladata`](https://crates.io/crates/ladata): mixed & modular data structures.
- [`repite`](https://crates.io/crates/repite): loop rates & counters.

## Status

Libera’s libraries are currently in an experimental stage of development.
