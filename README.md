A meaningful collection of simple, interrelated libraries and small utilities
aiming to liberate solo developers from the burden of unnecessary complexity,
by facilitating versatile abstractions that are easy to use and understand.

# Features

## Project template

The starting point for creating a new liberating Rust project.

To use, copy the `template/` directory under a *new_name*, enter it and run
`./configure_crate.sh new_name`, so that the template is adjusted.

## *Liberaries*

*Keep tuned*.

# Status

This is a work in progress, a process of discovery and a life-long journey.

Heavy development is expected to continue for the best part of 2022.
