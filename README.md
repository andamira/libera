# libera

A meaningful collection of simple, interrelated libraries and small utilities
aiming to liberate solo developers from the burden of unnecessary complexity,
by facilitating versatile abstractions that are easy to use and understand.

## Features

### template
A handy starting point for a new liberating project.

Copy the `template/` directory to the desired location using a new `name`,
enter it and run `./configure_crate.sh name`.

### functions

- `project_root_path*`: returns a path relative to the current project's root.
- `counter_string`: returns a string where you always know each character's position.

### liberaries

*keep tuned*â€¦

## Status

This is an experimental work in progress.
